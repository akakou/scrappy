## Dependencies

Scrappy is support Linux environments, and the work checked on  NixOS 23.05pre4.
Also, Scrappy needs the dependecies as follows:

- docker and docker-compose
- tpm-tools (https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools)

You can run the "go test" with some commands to measure benchmarks.
  
### Cryptographic process of Sign TPM
  
```sh
cd /scrappy/ecdaa
/usr/local/go/bin/go test ./bench -benchmem -run=^$ -bench SignTPM -benchtime 20x
```
  
### Sign Log
  
```sh
cd /scrappy/core
/usr/local/go/bin/go test ./tests -benchmem -run=^$ -bench BenchmarkSignLog -benchtime 20x
```
  
### Cryptographic process of Verification
  
```sh
cd /scrappy/ecdaa
go test ./bench -benchmem -run=^$ -bench BenchmarkVerify -benchtime 20x
```
  
### Verify Log
  
```sh
cd /scrappy/core
go test ./tests -benchmem -run=^$ -bench BenchmarkVerifyLog -benchtime 20x
```
